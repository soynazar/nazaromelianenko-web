      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        My professional path has been built at the intersection of education and technology—two 
        distinct fields that share a common requirement: understanding deeply in order to advance with purpose.
      </p>

    <section class="container page-grid">

        <h2>How I work</h2>
        <p>
          I work with respect for established processes, responsibility in every decision, 
          and direct communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          I value structure, consistency, and high-quality work as the foundation 
          for any meaningful progress.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I teach Spanish and Valencian to adults, with a specialized focus on 
          learners coming from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach integrates Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) strategies within a 
          Positive Learning Environment: ensuring safety, clarity, and a sustainable pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also specialize in preparing students for official certifications like 
          DELE and EOI, embedding test prep within a solid overall learning journey.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>
          I develop web projects focused on real utility, user experience (UX), 
          and clean code that is easy to understand and evolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing professional training in Application Development (DAM) 
          while building personal projects to refine my technical criteria and practice.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Values</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in relationships based on trust and in using clear criteria as a 
          form of respect toward people and the work itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in what is built with intention: step by step, 
          with consistency and high standards.
