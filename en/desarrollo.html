        I develop projects with structure and clear criteria, 
        focusing on essentials and building for long-term sustainability.

        <h2>Work Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          I am guided by justified technical decisions, lean yet useful documentation, 
          and an orderly process: understand, design, build, and review.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prioritize practical results: ensuring the product is seamless, 
          intuitive for the user, and easy to evolve.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Core Contributions</h2>
        <p>
          Web development focused on UX, performance, and clean code organization. 
          I am particularly interested in projects that combine technical precision with real utility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the objective is well-defined, the workflow becomes simpler, 
          more measurable, and easier to maintain.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I value working with clear criteria: structure, consistency, 
          effective time management, and direct communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Development is not just "making things," but building with intent 
          and respect for those who will use and maintain the code.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Focus</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Application Development (DAM)</strong>, 
          while building personal projects to consolidate technical criteria and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is part of that process: simple, understated, and constantly evolving.
