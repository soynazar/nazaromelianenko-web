      <h1>Teaching · Languages</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        I work with individuals seeking serious learning, 
        tailored to their pace with a focus on the deep process.

        <h2>Subjects</h2>
        <p>
          I teach <strong>Spanish</strong> and <strong>Valencian</strong>, with a specialized focus on learners 
          coming from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          My teaching adapts to both beginners and those who need to consolidate, 
          refine, or gain confidence in their language use.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
          I primarily work with adults learning languages for personal growth, 
          professional advancement, or social integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The focus is clear: making progress through a structured method, concrete goals, 
          and a working relationship built on trust.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Certification Prep</h2>
        <p>
          I offer specialized preparation for official certifications such as 
          <strong>DELE</strong> and <strong>EOI</strong>, integrated into a comprehensive learning process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of memorizing "tricks," we build a real foundation: comprehension, 
          expression, and confidence in authentic situations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          My method combines structure, practical application, and a supportive environment 
          through a <strong>Positive Learning Environment</strong> and <strong>Social-Emotional Learning (SEL)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means learning with calm, real high standards, and clarity; providing tools to manage 
          blocks, maintain motivation, and sustain steady progress.
